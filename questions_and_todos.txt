- "managers" (used for site access, but we will remove), "renters" and "storers" in db: "storers"="custodian"?
- "ScanFiles" in database but nowhere on site afaik--remove?
- Do viol custodians have to be society members? (yes is easier)
    - Waiting list: do they have to be members? (yes is easier)
    - Probable answer: They just need an account (which is free), then the
      rental manager can check their membership on the memsec page
- How do you add someone to the waiting list?
- How detailed event history do we need?
    - Rented out: yes
    - Returned: yes
    - Reserved: do we care about this?
    - Made available: do we care about this? is this "unreserving"
- What really is the difference between "rented" and "reserved"? Whether they have to pay money for it?

TODOS:
- Allow rental_manager users to access read-only memsec directory
- James: set up filesystem image storage
- "Viols" pages
- "Cases" pages
- Waiting list
- List of current renters
- Add "reserved_for" one to one from Viol to User
- Add "is_retired" field to bow, case, viol
- "Rent out" form (create RentalHistory view)
- "Make available" endpoint/"event"
- Make "event" in rental history use TextChoices
