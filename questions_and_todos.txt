- "managers" (used for site access, but we will remove), "renters" and "storers" in db: "storers"="custodian"?

- Do viol custodians have to be society members? (yes is easier)
    - Waiting list: do they have to be members? (yes is easier)
    - Probable answer: They just need an account (which is free), then the
      rental manager can check their membership on the memsec page
- How do you add someone to the waiting list?
- How detailed event history do we need?
    - Rented out: yes
    - Returned: yes
    - Reserved: do we care about this?
    - Made available: do we care about this? is this "unreserving"
- What really is the difference between "rented" and "reserved"? Whether they have to pay money for it?
- What is "select reserve"?
- What does it mean for a renter to be "active"?
- Are business rules different for consort loan? (probably not)

TODOS:
- Allow rental_manager users to access read-only memsec directory
- James: set up filesystem image storage
- "Viols" pages
- "Cases" pages
- Waiting list
- List of current renters
- Add "reserved_for" one to one from Viol to User
- Add "is_retired" field to bow, case, viol
- "Rent out" form (create RentalHistory view)
- "Make available" endpoint/"event"
- Make "event" in rental history use TextChoices
- "ScanFiles" (rename) is a scan the rental contract
    - first opportunity to upload after submitting the rental
    - Can't figure out where to add the contract later
        - Make contract required part of the "rent out" form?

OTHER
- On current site, adding to waiting list for specific viol doesn't work (always does "any")
    - Just have one button, make the specific viol list nullable, with null option displayed as "any"

Nice things
- way to go straight from waiting list to rental
